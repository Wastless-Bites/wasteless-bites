<h1 align="center">Welcome to Wasteless Bites</h1>
<h3 align="center">We are dedicated in stopping food waste.</h3>

**Saving the world one bite at a time.**

Every day restaurants have an excess amount of food at the end of each day and throw away all the leftovers. Wasteless Bites can help prevent unnecessary waste and help those that might be in need for free. Restaurants can use the website to post/share food for people instead of throwing it away at the end of day. It is also a great way to raise awareness about their surplus food items and attract potential customers.

In order to run our application run the following commands on your terminal:

```
npm install
npm run seed
npm run start:dev
```

After running the last command you can now check out the website on: **localhost:8080**

You can then log in as an individual or an organization and will be directed to the _feed_ which you now have access to the full site where you can find ads in different areas and possibly snack a free meal. Feel free to upload and customize your profile. You can also leave reviews on different resturants after you've tried their food.
